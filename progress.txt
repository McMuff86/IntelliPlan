# IntelliPlan - Ralph Progress Log

## Codebase Patterns
<!-- Add reusable patterns here as they are discovered -->
<!-- Example: Use `sql<number>` template for aggregations -->
<!-- Example: Always use `IF NOT EXISTS` for migrations -->

Thread: https://ampcode.com/threads/T-019bb959-ef98-70d3-8968-161c39a15ead  
- Backend: Node.js/Express with TypeScript initialized  
- Frontend: React with Vite, Material-UI, TypeScript initialized  
- Database: PostgreSQL migrations created (teams, users, appointments)  
- Migration runner at npm run migrate  
  
**Files created:**

**Learnings for future iterations:**  
- Use IF NOT EXISTS for all CREATE TABLE/INDEX statements  
- Vite requires type-only imports (import type) for verbatimModuleSyntax  
- ESLint v9 requires flat config but we used legacy .eslintrc.json
